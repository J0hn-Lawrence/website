# website

This is currently a very basic website. It's a work in progress and will be updated as time goes on.

## What is this website?

This website will be used as a landing page for me and in the future, may be used for more than that (maybe Project Pages, maybe a Blog, maybe a Portfolio, maybe a combination of all of them).

## What is this website built with?

This website is based on @charlolaÂ´s Hugo theme which is based on the Hugo framework. It's quick and easy to use with minimal design and the most basic functions.
